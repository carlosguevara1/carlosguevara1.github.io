  "Macroeconomic stability is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. Without stability, uncertainty discourages investment, both domestic and foreign, and undermines long-term development prospects."<br>
  — Michael P. Todaro & Stephen C. Smith, <em>Economic Development</em>, 12th ed. (2015), p. 698.

Just a young economist inspired by the hard-work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6odPP0zAdFQ&ab_channel=Footballer%27sStories" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, the genius of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/samuelson-lecture.pdf" target="_blank">Paul Samuelson</a> and the creativity of <a href="https://www.paradigmpress.org/as/article/view/447" target="_blank">Quentin Tarantino</a>. Very proud to represent the first generation in my family to graduate from university and having attained significant milestones throughout my professional career.

Currently, I serve as Research Analyst for the United States Desk at the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/USA" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a>, contributing to the research and policy agendas of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chimainy/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Mai Dao</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/philip-barrett/home" target="_blank">Philip Barrett</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jaebinahn/" target="_blank">JaeBin Ahn</a>, and <a href="https://jingzhoujz.github.io/" target="_blank">Jing Zhou</a>. My work includes machine learning analysis of migration-labor administrative data, GDP nowcasting, recession turning point prediction, and contributions to the U.S. WEO forecast workflow.

Previously, I was Research Assistant to Andrew Powell, Technical Advisor at the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/res" target="_blank">IDB</a>, focusing on macro-financial issues at both aggregate and micro levels. My work included probability of default modeling, banking microdata analysis, and macro risk scenario formulation with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gvarmodelling/gvar" target="_blank">G-VAR models</a>, contributing to the Macro Report series (<a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/viewer/2021-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Macroeconomic-Report-Opportunities-for-Stronger-and-Sustainable-Postpandemic-Growth.pdf" target="_blank">2021</a>, <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/2022-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Macroeconomic-Report-From-Recovery-to-Renaissance-Turning-Crisis-into-Opportunity.pdf" target="_blank">2022</a>, <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/2023-Latin-American-and-Caribbean-Macroeconomic-Report-Preparing-the-Macroeconomic-Terrain-for-Renewed-Growth.pdf" target="_blank">2023</a>). Prior to that, I was a Data Analyst at the <a href="https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/en" target="_blank">Central Bank of Peru</a>.

Beyond my working hours, I enjoy contributing to the open source community by developing statistical packages. Our main project, <a href="https://github.com/d2cml-ai/csdid" target="_blank">csdid</a> that implements the staggered DiD estimator proposed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407620303948" target="_blank"> Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)</a> in Python, achieved significant impact, reaching over <a href="https://pepy.tech/projects/csdid?timeRange=threeMonths&category=version&includeCIDownloads=true&granularity=daily&viewType=line&versions=0.2.8%2C0.2.7%2C0.2.5" target="_blank">70,000 downloads</a>. Other times, when I am not programming or stuyding, I enjoy photography, salsa dancing and international food.

I obtained both my BS and Licenciatura in Economics from the <a href="https://www.pucp.edu.pe/carrera/economia/" target="_blank">Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP)</a>, widely regarded as Peru’s premier university. I then ranked among the top three students nationally in the Advanced Economics Summer Course at the Central Bank of Peru, an experience that marked the beginning of my career as a macroeconomist.
